; decode.asm - extract every field from a 20-byte IPv4 header.
;
; This is your starting point. It assembles and links as-is, so the build
; works before you write any code. Right now it stores nothing, so renpkt
; prints the zeros driver.c put in the struct. Your job is to replace that
; with the extraction described below.
;
; The contract, from driver.c:
;
;       struct ipv4_fields *out   [ebp+12]
;       unsigned char *hdr        [ebp+8]
;
; hdr points at twenty bytes in network byte order. out points at the struct
; documented in driver.c. Its offsets are:
;
;   +0 version   +4 ihl    +8 dscp   +12 ecn   +16 total_length
;   +20 identification    +24 flags  +28 fragment_offset
;   +32 ttl      +36 protocol       +40 checksum
;   +44 src[0..3]                   +48 dst[0..3]
;
; Every int member is 4 bytes, so a plain 32-bit store fills one. The
; addresses are four single-byte stores each.
;
; Do not clobber ebx, esi, edi, or ebp. C assumes they survive your call.
; Return in eax (driver.c ignores it here, so returning 0 is fine).
;

; Windows C puts a leading underscore on every exported name. Linux C does
; not. The Makefile passes -d ELF_TYPE on Linux. This block then respells
; the names below to match. asm_io.inc does the same for _asm_main in the
; bootcamp blocks. Leave this block alone.

        ; that matter before you start:
        ;
        ;   * Every multi-byte field is big-endian, so load it byte by byte
        ;     and recombine. A single 16-bit load gives you the bytes
        ;     reversed.
        ;   * The fragment offset straddles a byte boundary. Its top five
        ;     bits live in byte 6 and its bottom eight in byte 7. Combine
        ;     both bytes into one word first, then shift and mask.
        ;   * The flags are the top three bits of the same word.
        ;   * Read and store the checksum field like any other field.
        ;     ip_checksum computes the VALID line separately.
        ;   * src and dst are four single-byte stores each. No shifting.
        ;
        ; Nothing here reads the file or prints. This routine only fills
        ; the struct, and driver.c does the rest.
