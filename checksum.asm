; checksum.asm - the one's complement internet checksum.
;
; This is your starting point. It assembles and links as-is, so the build
; works before you write any code. Right now it always returns 0, which
; makes every header decode as VALID. The decode path sums the header as it
; stands and tests for zero, so a routine that returns 0 says "valid" for
; everything. Your job is to replace that with the sum described below.
;
; The contract, from driver.c:
;
;       int len                   [ebp+12]
;       unsigned char *hdr        [ebp+8]
;
; Sum len bytes of hdr as len/2 16-bit big-endian words into a 32-bit
; accumulator. Fold the carries until the result fits in 16 bits. Return
; the one's complement of that in ax. The manual's worked example is the
; test. Zero the checksum field, sum the sample header, and you must get
; 0x9CBC.
;
; The decode path calls this over the header as it stands, checksum field
; included. A valid header returns 0 and an invalid one does not. The
; encode path calls it over a header whose checksum field you wrote as zero.
; One routine serves both uses. You don't need to know which one called
; you.
;
; Do not clobber ebx, esi, edi, or ebp. C assumes they survive your call.
;

; Windows C puts a leading underscore on every exported name. Linux C does
; not. The Makefile passes -d ELF_TYPE on Linux. This block then respells
; the names below to match. asm_io.inc does the same for _asm_main in the
; bootcamp blocks. Leave this block alone.

        ; The manual's recipe:
        ;
        ;   1. Treat the header as 16-bit big-endian words. Load each byte
        ;      pair and recombine. Never load the pair as a single 16-bit
        ;      value, which gives you the bytes reversed.


        ;   2. Add each word to a 32-bit accumulator. Keep the carries. The
        ;      fold below returns them to the sum.

        xor eax, eax    ; set eax to 0
        sum_loop:
                cmp     ecx, 0
                jle     fold
                movzx   ebx, byte[esi]
                shl     ebx, 8
                movzx   edx, byte[esi + 1]
                or      ebx, edx
                add     eax, ebx        ; 32-bit accumulator
                add     esi, 2
                sub     ecx, 2
                jmp     sum_loop

        ;   3. While the accumulator exceeds 16 bits, add its high half to
        ;      its low half. This is the end-around carry. A large sum can
        ;      need the fold twice.

        fold:
                ; while (eax >> 16) != 0: eax = (eax & 0xFFFF) + (eax >> 16)
                ; to be done

        ;   4. NOT the low 16 bits. That is the checksum.

                not     eax
                and     eax, 0xFFFF

        ;
        ; len is always even, since the driver calls this with 20. A loop
        ; that consumes two bytes per iteration and stops on ecx == 0 is
        ; enough. Leave the answer in ax when you return.
