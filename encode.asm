; encode.asm - build a 20-byte IPv4 header from the field struct.
;
; This is your starting point. It assembles and links as-is, so the build
; works before you write any code. Right now it writes nothing, so the
; twenty bytes driver.c saves are whatever the buffer held. Your job is to
; replace that with the construction described below.
;
; * where arguments came from
; The contract, from driver.c:
;
;       unsigned char *hdr        [ebp+12]
;       struct ipv4_fields *in    [ebp+8]
;
; * driver.c documents the struct layout:
;
;   +0 version   +4 ihl    +8 dscp   +12 ecn   +16 total_length
;   +20 identification    +24 flags  +28 fragment_offset
;   +32 ttl      +36 protocol       +40 checksum
;   +44 src[0..3]                   +48 dst[0..3]
;
; * big endian req
; You write twenty bytes into hdr. Every multi-byte field goes out
; big-endian: the high byte first. The fragment offset's top five bits share
; byte 6 with the three flag bits. Its bottom eight bits are byte 7.
;
; * checksum is last & zero is fist
; The checksum is your job too. Bytes 10-11 must read as zero while the
; checksum is computed. Write them as zero, call ip_checksum over the
; finished header, and store its result into the field. The struct's
; checksum member is read on the decode path only. Don't copy it here.
;
; *cdecl obligations
;
; *Do not clobber ebx, esi, edi, or ebp. 
; C assumes they survive your call.
; Return in eax (driver.c ignores it here, so returning 0 is fine).
;

; Windows C puts a leading underscore on every exported name. Linux C does
; not. The Makefile passes -d ELF_TYPE on Linux. This block then respells
; the names below to match. asm_io.inc does the same for _asm_main in the
; bootcamp blocks. Leave this block alone.

        ; This is the reverse of decode. Mask each field to its width,
        ; shift it up to where it lives, or the pieces of a shared byte
        ; together, then store the byte. The fields that do not straddle
        ; anything are one store each.
        ;
        ; The checksum comes last, after every other byte is written. Write
        ; bytes 10-11 as zero, call ip_checksum with the header and 20, and
        ; store its result (in ax) into the field big-endian. Computing it
        ; before the rest of the header is in place sums whatever garbage
        ; was in the buffer. ip_checksum preserves ebx, esi, edi, and ebp,
        ; so a pointer kept in one of those survives the call. eax, ecx, and
        ; edx do not.
